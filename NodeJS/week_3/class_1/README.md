# 📘 Understanding Routers and Controllers in Express.js

---

## 🚦 1. What Is a Router in Express.js?

A **router** is responsible for defining the **endpoints/URLs** of your application and connecting them to their respective functions (controllers).

### ✔ What routers do:

* Listen for incoming HTTP requests
* Match the request to a route (`GET /users`, `POST /login`, etc.)
* Forward the request to the correct controller

### ✔ What routers do *NOT* do:

* They do NOT contain business logic
* They do NOT handle database operations
* They do NOT validate or process data

Routers simply define **“where to go.”**

### 🧠 Real-life example:

Think of a router as a **security guard** at a building's entry gate.
He only tells people:

* “You go to the kitchen.”
* “You go to the meeting room.”
* “You go to the office.”

He does NOT cook, manage meetings, or handle office tasks.

## 🧩 2. What Is a Controller?

A **controller** contains the actual logic that should run when a route receives a request.

### ✔ What controllers do:

* Fetch data from a database
* Save or update data
* Validate input
* Send a json response back
* Handle errors

### ✔ What controllers do NOT do:

* They do not define URLs
* They do not set route paths

Controllers simply contain the **“actual code”** that performs operations.

### 🧠 Real-life example:

If the router is the guard, then the controller is the **chef** or **staff** inside the building who performs the real work.

## 🛠 3. Folder Structure (Recommended)

A clean Express project should organize routes and controllers separately:

```
.
├── controllers
│     └── user.controller.js
├── routes
│     └── user.routes.js
├── index.js
└── package.json
```

This structure improves:

* Readability
* Maintenance
* Scalability
* Team collaboration

## 📄 4. Example: Router and Controller in Express.js

### 📁 `controllers/user.controller.ts`

```ts
import { Request, Response } from "express";

export const getAllUsers = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    // Example data (replace with DB call)
    const users = [
      { id: 1, name: "John" },
      { id: 2, name: "Alice" }
    ];

    res.json({ success: true, users });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: "Server Error" });
  }
};

export const createUser = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const { name } = req.body;

    res.json({ success: true, message: "User Created", name });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: "Server Error" });
  }
};
```

---

### 📁 `routes/user.routes.ts`

```ts
import express from "express";
import { getAllUsers, createUser } from "../controllers/user.controller";

const router = express.Router();

// GET /users
router.get("/", getAllUsers);

// POST /users
router.post("/", createUser);

export default router;
```

---

### 📁 `index.ts` (Main File)

```ts
import express from "express";
import userRoutes from "./routes/user.routes";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Mounting user routes
app.use("/users", userRoutes);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

> 💡 **Note:** With `esModuleInterop`/`moduleResolution: "node"` set in `tsconfig.json` (as used throughout this course), you import local TypeScript files **without** the `.js`/`.ts` extension — unlike plain Node.js ES Modules, which require the extension.

---

## 🔄 5. How Routers and Controllers Work Together

1. User hits URL:
   `GET /users`

2. Router checks for a matching route:
   `router.get("/", getAllUsers)`

3. Router forwards this request to the controller function:
   → `getAllUsers()`

4. Controller executes logic and sends response.

This separation keeps everything:

* clean
* organized
* professional
* easy to maintain

## 🎯 6. Why Should You Use Routers + Controllers?

### ✔ Benefits:

| Benefit                 | Explanation                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clean Code**          | Logic is separated from route definitions               |
| **Better Organization** | Large apps become easier to manage                      |
| **Scalability**         | Adding new routes and logic becomes simple              |
| **Team-friendly**       | Developers can work independently on routes/controllers |
| **Reusability**         | Controllers can be reused in multiple routes            |

---

## 🔥 7. Example with Database (Optional: Prisma, MongoDB, etc.)

Controller handles actual DB logic:

```ts
import { Request, Response } from "express";
import Post from "../models/post.model";

export const getPosts = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const posts = await Post.find();
  res.json(posts);
};
```

Router connects URL to controller:

```js
router.get("/", getPosts);
```

Main file loads route:

```js
app.use("/posts", postRoutes);
```

---

## 📌 8. Final Summary

✔ **Router** = defines the URL and forwards the request
✔ **Controller** = handles actual logic and response

You should always separate routes and controllers in Express.js to write **professional and scalable applications**.
